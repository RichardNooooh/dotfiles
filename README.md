# Dotfiles

Organized dotfiles inspired by ThePrimeagen

## Prerequisites
I might want to create an install script that installs all of these...

- `zsh`
- `nvim`
- `ghostty`

We also need to have an `.env` file with the `WINDOW_CONFIG` varible that stores the
location of the user home directory in Windows like `/mnt/c/Users/{USER}`.

`yasb` requires a `.env` file containing `YASB_WEATHER_API_KEY` and 
`YASB_WEATHER_LOCATION`.

### kickstart nvim
this one requires ripgrep and fd-find. not sure if I will need or really want them later on.
